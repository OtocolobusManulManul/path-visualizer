# Astar-visualizer

python program that generates an interactive graph of the statespaces formed by the A* algorotithm when solving the "Cat's and Dog'problem"

at a later date I will probably turn this into a more generalized tool that can be used to visualize the statespaces and traversal path of any algorithm.
