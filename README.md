# Astar-visualizer

python program that generates an interactive graph of the statespaces formed by the A* algorotithm when solving the "Cat's and Dog'problem"

at a later date I will probably turn this into a more generalized tool that can be used to visualize the statespaces and traversal path of any algorithm. I should also probably redo astar_visualizer at some point, given that I can make the code much better now that I am familiar with the libraries.
