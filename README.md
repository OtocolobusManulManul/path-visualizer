# algorithm visualizer

two short python scripts that generate interactive graphs that can be used to help visualize the control flow of a couple search algorithms.

at a later date I will probably turn this into a more generalized tool that can be used to visualize the statespaces and traversal path of any algorithm and perhaps program memory. I should also probably redo astar_visualizer at some point, given that I can make the code much better now that I am familiar with the libraries.


to cover dependancies  run 

```
pip install lxml igraph plotly anytree
```

tested on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044 and python 3.10.4
